#
#	This table contains the data the Unicode Consortium has on how
#       KOI8-R characters map into Unicode. The underlying document is the
#	mapping described in RFC 1489. No statements are made as to whether
#	this mapping is the same as the mapping defined as "Code Page 878"
#	with some vendors.

#		 Column #1 is the KOI8-R code (in hex as 0xXX)
#		 Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
